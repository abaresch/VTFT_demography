# VTFT_demography
VTFT method for simulating age-classes in a global ecosystem model 

__./code_pseudo__<br/>
Pseudo code is provided for main portions of the ageclass module in LPJ. Header files with example data structures of ageclasses (stands) are included. Ancillary functions and data structures may be referenced and although such structures and variables are heavily annotated for comphrension, they may not be included in this pseudo code. As such, the pseudo code cannot be compiled or run. Ancillary functions, headers, and other files are necessary to fully compile LPJ. Nevertheless, these pseudo code files represent the foundation for the ageclass module and the code can be used to implement the method in other models.
